📰 **News Aggregator**

A miniature search engine that parses RSS feeds, indexes and ranks news article content using TF-IDF, and simulates core features of a real news aggregator like Google News or Yahoo News. This project demonstrates indexing, information retrieval, algorithm analysis, and ethical considerations in personalized content delivery.

🔍 **Overview**

This project replicates the behavior of a news aggregator by:
- Parsing RSS feeds and HTML documents from multiple sources.
- Building forward and inverted indexes of document contents.
- Applying TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to score and rank terms.
- Supporting features like autocomplete and a default homepage for query simulation.

📚 **Concepts Covered**
- Web Crawling using Jsoup (RSS & HTML parsing)
- Indexing (Forward and Inverted Indexes)
- Information Retrieval via TF-IDF scoring
- Sorted and Ordered Structures
- Map and Collection Structures
- Ethical Reasoning around content personalization and algorithmic bias
